Key Highlights of the Project
Achieved the following accuracies during manual optimization and brute force training:
  Training Accuracy: 91%
  Validation Accuracy: 92%
  Test Accuracy: 93%

Potential for improvement through advanced optimization techniques such as hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Optuna, Keras Tuner).

This notebook is fully runnable without additional configuration, as it downloads all dependencies from the initial cells.

Includes integration with Kaggle for easy dataset handling and experimentation.
